### 👋 About Me

I’m Panos, a final-year Computer Science & Engineering student at the University of Ioannina (Greece).  
I love building things that *just work* — from backend services and automation tools to low-level systems.

My academic background has given me a solid understanding of how computers work **from theory to code**:  
algorithms, data structures, compilers, operating systems, networks, AI — I enjoy the big picture **and** the details.

I work best when I’m deep in code, solving problems, debugging tricky behavior, or designing systems with clarity and purpose.
